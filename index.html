<p style="text-align: justify;"> Plan: Formulate a master plan; 3) Do: List the action alternatives; 4) Check or
    see: Evaluate the preliminary results and decide upon a control procedure, and
    5) Action: Implement. These stages are based on the procedure known to
    Management Science as PDCA, or Plan, Do, Check, and Action.
    A more detailed description of each phase follows (Kinoshita, 1996, Porter,
    1980):
    <ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><li>Select phase:</li></b>A strategy can be selected according to the problem the
        organization faces, and it can be: a strategy in a situation of risk or
        uncertainty, a strategy in a situation of competition or conflict, a strategy
        of multiple objectives or goals, a strategy for economic analysis, a strategy
        for optimization, decision making in a complex situation, etc.</p>
        

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><li> Plan phase:</li></b>Planning should define “who” is the decision maker, e.g., the
    government, a school, a certain company; “what” is the purpose of the
    decision, e.g., to purchase real estate, sell new products, and “why” this
    decision-making process is necessary, e.g., to obtain more space, earn
    more revenue, etc. Then, through theoretical and empirical research,
    possible trade-offs of several alternatives are found, and then a master
    plan to proceed with the decision-making strategy can be developed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><li>Do phase:</li></b> In a case of alternatives to construct a building or produce
    goods, one needs to define the requirements for functionality, security,
    quality, durability, form (beauty, harmony), the materials to be used (new
    materials), and the production process (how?) for this product or good.
    To choose a service or a technology, a similar procedure should be
    adopted. The new elements that have been incorporated should be
    measured in a quantitative or qualitative way to gauge the trade-offs of the
    master plan.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><li>Check phase:</li></b>In this phase the alternatives of the master plan, detailed
        to include the characteristics listed in phase three, should be tested for
        performance in aspects of quality, economic factors, efficiency, and
        security. The results obtained in this phase are taken into consideration to
        improve the decision-making master plan. Procedures that make restructuring possible from the systemic point of view, procedures for control and
        administration of the process, as well as a system to evaluate the results
        obtained should be incorporated in this phase.</p>

    
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b><li>Action phase:</li></b>This is the phase of implementing procedures; the results
    obtained are evaluated and the original problem is restructured through feedback from the learning acquired. The need to broaden the scope and
    the finality of the problem by incorporating new goals or functional
    characteristics can be considered at this stage, sending the problem back
    to the planning stage.</p>
    </ol>
    
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, how would one describe the five stages in detail in the following
    cases?</p>

<ol type ="a">
    <li><p style="text-align: justify;">  XYZ company is studying the possibility of purchasing land to install a new
        branch office. What would the structured procedures be to determine the
        alternatives orstrategies for this decision-making problem? What kind
        of land, where should it be located and how many pieces of real estate
        should be considered? What are the criteria, goals, or objectives for the
        choice of this land? Should the price of the land, payment conditions,
        estimates of final profit, the location, size, etc. be taken into consideration?
        What would other criteria or objectives be?</p></li>
    <li><p style="text-align: justify;"> Another common decision-making problem is about financial investment.
        Should one invest in real estate, the stock market, savings, dollars, or
        investment funds? What are the rates of return and under what economic
        conditions or perspectives would one investment be more advantageous
        than another? Does the company or investor want an indication for
        investment in the short, medium, or long-term? Would the investors like
        to learn to improve the composition of an investment portfolio? Or would
        they like to learn the advantages and disadvantages of the process of
        migrating from one investment to another?</p></li>

    </ol>

<i>Sensitivity Analysis</i>
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 2px;background-color: black;"></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to making the BEST DECISION at the time, the company might
    also like to know the other possible decision alternatives. The company could
    be content with a good decision within its possibilities or, the second-best
    decision might be more appropriate. A procedure known as sensitivity
    analysis, that analyzes the possibilities of decision around a chosen solution, is
    usually used. In general, the company or the decider would like to ask the
    following type of question (known aswhat-if? question) (Turban & Aronson,
    1998; Mallach, 2000):
    </p>
<i><p style="text-align: justify;">"What would happen to the chosen decision, if the panorama or
    conditions were different?"
    </p></i>
    
<h2>Rationality Used in Decision Models</h2>
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Simon (1958) posits two basic kinds of decisions in arguing that:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> "...in social science, at one extreme we have the economists who
    attribute to economic man a preposterously omniscient rationality. Economic man has a complete and consistent system of
    preferences that allows him always to choose among the alternatives open to him; he is completely aware of what these alternatives are; there are no limits on the complexity of the computations
    he can perform in order to determine which alternatives are best;
    probability calculations are neither frightening nor mysterious to
    him...</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i>...it seems obvious enough that human behavior in organizations
    is, if not wholly rational, at least in good part intendedly so. Much
    behavior in organizations is, or seems to be, task oriented - and
    sometimes efficacious in attaining its goals...</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> But, it seems equally apparent to one who observes behavior in
        organization, that there is none of the global omniscience that is
        attributed to economic man.
        </i></p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;"> <i>While economic man maximizes - selects the best alternative
            from among all those available to him; his cousin, whom we shall
            call administrative man looks for a course of action that is
            satisfactory or 'good enough'. Examples of satisfactory criteria
            that are familiar enough to businessmen are 'share of market',
            'adequate profit', 'fair price'.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i>Administrative man recognizes that the world perceives is a
    drastically simplified model of the real world. He makes his choices
    using a simple picture of the situation that takes into account just
    a few of the factors that he regards as most relevant and crucial.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> We will then describe people as rational human beings, but with a
    less grandiose rationality than that proclaimed by the economic
    man. That is, we are admitting the existence of <b>"Bounded Rationality."</b></i></p>    

<p style="text-align: justify;"> To sum up Simon’s thinking, we can say that:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li> <b>the economic man:</b></li>

    <ol type="i"> 
        <li> <p style="text-align: justify;"> works with the real world in all its complexity and confusion;</p></li>
        <li> <p style="text-align: justify;"> adopts an “optimum standard” of reality, choosing the best existing
            alternative.</p></li>
    </ol> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, it is not difficult to perceive that these complete or perfect models
    are hard to formulate and manipulate in practice, due to the difficulty of
    obtaining complete knowledge of the problem from this point of view and the
    related difficulties in computation. The economist model considers all the
    possible alternatives, the large majority of which are superfluous or of little
    importance with reference to the decision to be taken. Thus the process of
    decision making is almost always conducted by using the strategies and models
    professed by the administrative man.</p>

<li> <b> the administrative man: </b></li>

<ol type="i"> 
    <li><p style="text-align: justify;"> works with a drastically simplified model of reality, since he or she
        perceives that most of the facts of this real world are not of great
        relevance to the specific situation and that the link between cause
        and effect should be simple.</p></li>
        <li><p style="text-align: justify;">adopts a “satisfactory or good enough standard” of the world
            formed by a limited number of choice alternatives that satisfactorily meet the problem, and is content to find satisfactory or adequate
            solutions.</p></li>
            
</ol>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> What is a drastically simplified model? What do we understand by satisfactory standard? In the following sections we will try to define the characteristics
    of a decision-making model that can answer these questions
    </p>
    <h2>Behavior of People and Organizations
    </h2>
    <div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The behavior of a person or organization faced with a decision is guided by
    objectives and general goals. This comportment is of the rational kind because
    persons or organizations select alternatives that lead in the best way possible
    to achieve their objectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An organization is characterized by specialization, i.e., the execution of specific
    tasks is delegated to specific parts of the organization. This specialization can
    take the form of “vertical” delegation of responsibilities or tasks, or of the
    “horizontal” type when division of labor is the basic characteristic of the
    organization. More modern proposals from organizational theory have other
    names for organizational structures such as: “matrix” form of organization,
    organization by projects, or departmentalization. Thus, it is inevitable that there
    exists a “hierarchy of decisions”, i.e., a decision made by someone in a certain
    position in the hierarchy prevails over decision made by subordinates. Thus, a
    decision made by a subordinate should be in accordance with decisions taken
    by his superior (Simon 1958, 1997).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Generally, a decision of society prevails over a decision made by an organiza-tion; a decision taken in a stockholders´ meeting prevails over a decision taken
    by the president of an organization, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In practice, it is possible to find some organization, or part of it, that can be
    called an “anarchic organization,” and is represented by the “garbage can
    model” proposed by Cohen et al. (1972). This model considers the decision-making process in such anarchic organizations as an enormous garbage can
    where problems to be resolved are tossed. Well-structured or top priority
    problems are resolved immediately and taken out of the garbage can. Other
    problems are taken out after a superficial examination or are taken out of the
    can because they are taking up space. Many problems which are ignored
    remain on the bottom of the garbage can, which requires periodic emptying of
    its contents.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Under the behavioral point of view, decision theory also classifies persons and
        organizations into three types:</p>

<p>
    <li> those that have a <i>preference for risk</i></li>
    <li> those that are<i>neutral toward risk,  </i> and </li>
    <li> those that have an<i> aversion for risk.</i></li>
</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Rational Concepts Adopted</h1>        
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The following four concepts, which represent the essence of decision making
    theory in the companies, were developed to define the concept of rational
    decision-making process (Cyert & March, 1963). They are:
    </p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b> Near resolution of conflict in the organization’s objectives.</b>  In
        considering the dimension of the objectives or goals, it is inevitable that
        each group inside the organization desires different objectives. Traditionally, these differences were specified by assigning monetary values which
        correspond to the objectives of each group. In the new conception, the
        organization’s goals correspond to a series of restrictions imposed by
        independent levels of aspiration of the groups inside the organization.
        After listing and prioritizing all the requirements and limitations, including
        the nonessential, sporadic and nonoperational ones, only the essential
        objectives that will be operational are taken into consideration.</p></li>
    <li><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b> Minimize uncertainty and risk.</b>All modern organizations constantly
        live under risk conditions caused by uncertainties of various kinds, and
        these uncertainties should be avoided or minimized through:</p> </li>
<ol type="a"> 
    <li><p style="text-align: justify;">  an emphasis on <i> immediate response and short term feedback,
    </i> avoiding uncertainties deriving from long-term strategies or events.</p> </li>
    <li> <p style="text-align: justify;"> adopting <i> day-to-day decisions and planning</i> that do not depend
        on predicting the future and market uncertainties: for example, a
        decision about production levels is often made using predictions
        based on experience, even though there are data resulting from
        scientifically formulated predictions.</p></li>
    <li> <p style="text-align: justify;"> an environment of <i> negotiation</i> with the organizational divisions,
        with the customers, with the supplier, banks, etc. Negotiations
        minimize risks, although they do not necessarily maximize the gains.</p> </li>
</ol>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b> Search for solutions in the neighborhood of the main objective.</b> The
    search for solutions to a problem should be neither random nor exhaustive.
    The search for a solution within the organization should be guided around
    the main objective of the problem and the possible alternative solutions
    should be sought in the neighborhood of the current alternatives.
    </p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"> If the search for a solution does not yield satisfactory results, the company
    usually seeks ever more complex solutions or looks to other areas distant
    from the original solution or in the last instance, seeks solutions for some
    “weak areas” of the company, for example, “training competent  in order to improve quality and productivity or, “prioritizing
    research activity”, taking on the risk of a no-return investment.</p> </li>
<li> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Constant learning and adaptation of the organization.</b> An organization always shows adaptive behavior over time. It can be assumed that the
    organization will change its objective, refocus its attention and revise its
    problem-solving procedures based on its experiences.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Organizational learning can take place in various ways, such as:
</p>
</li>
<ol type="a"> 
    <li> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b> adaptation of the rules and priorities — </b>  the organization prefers
        some criteria, ignoring others, e.g., the concern with environmental
        factors obliges it to pay more attention to certain problems in the
        production process, and 
        </p></li>
    <li> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b> adaptation of the rules of problem solving</b>  because the organization may experience either success or failure during the implementation of chosen alternatives.</p></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The organization can feel that its decision-making methods should be changed
    (to an alternative method or a more complex one) to the extent that it senses
    incompatibilities between the desired objectives and the results obtained. For
    example, a local problem can become global, a problem with a single objective
    can become one of multiple objectives, a problem with uncertainty based on
    probability theory can be explained using new properties of the possibility
    theory. All these problems may require additional rules to include some
    problems of environmental conflict, legislation, etc.
     </p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">  Classification of
    Decision-Making Situations</h1>
    <div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The simplification suggested by Simon’s <i> bounded rationality principle</i> can be
    considered as a starting point to analyze the complex decision-making problem
    found in organizations. Simon’s principle helps us to start classifying and
    analyzing the decision making process in detail.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> First, problems can be classified into three categories: structured, semi-structured, and nonstructured problems (Dyson, 1990; Turban & Aronson, 1998). </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> A problem is considered to be <i> structured</i>  if its definition and the phases of
        operation required to arrive at the desired results are very clear and its repeated
        execution is always possible. As examples of structured problems, we mention
        the payroll problem, accounting procedures, and data processing operations in
        general.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Semi-structured problems</i> are problems with well known operations, but that
            have some variable factors or criteria that can influence the results, that are
            common in forecasting problems and sales strategies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <i>nonstructured problems, </i> neither the scenarios nor the decision making-criteria are fixed or previously known.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In addition, a decision about any one of the three kinds of problems (structured,
    semi-structured, and nonstructured) can be differentiated by the <i> level of decision:
    </i></p>

    <li> <b> strategic</b> (usually, a decision for two to five years),</li>
    <li> <b> tactical</b> (decision for a few months up to two years),</li>
    <li> <b>operational</b> (a few days or a few months), and</li>
    <li> <b> dispatching</b> (an “in loco” decision just for some hours).</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In general, strategic decision problems are semi or nonstructured problems. An
    example of a non-structured problem with operational level of decision,
    mentioned by Turban, is the operation of choosing the cover for a weekly
    magazine (or the front page of a daily newspaper), where diverse alternatives
    are foreseen, but all can be replaced at the last minute if something important
    happens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> There are superimpositions among the types of problems and the levels of
    decision, but the responsibility for the decision belongs to distinct groups of
    deciders. For example, the problem of choosing the cover for a weekly
    magazine can be decided at the operational level by the staff of editors, or it can
    be decided by the dispatch kind of decision if the need for change occurs during
    the printing phase of the magazine. A nonstructured problem such as investing
    in R&D cannot be decided at the operational level, but only at the strategic
    level. Large-sized semi-structured or nonstructured problems can only be
    analyzed and resolved appropriately through the support of decision-making
    software.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Usually, a <i> strategic decision</i> is mainly concerned with outside problems, or
    with problems involving the entire company and its environment. Tactical
    decisions are concerned with the structuring of company resources to create
    alternatives for execution, aiming for the best results.<i> Operational decisions</i> aim at maximizing the efficiency of the process of converting resources, or
    maximizing income from current operations. While distinct, all of these decisions interact among themselves, and are interdependent and complementary.
    Saaty (1994) contends that many excellent deciders do not use theory to help
    them decide and asks the following question, “are good decisions accidental or
    are there logical principles that guide reasoning in the decision making process?
    Are these principles complete and consistent?”
    </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In the decision-making process, there are several concerns about group or
    individual decisions. Strategic decisions tend to be taken by groups and the
    operational decisions by individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Table 8.1 sums up the kinds of problems and levels of decision that can be
    adopted. The choice of a model depends on the purpose of the decision, time,
    </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Table 8.1. Types of problems and level of decision (adapted from Turban
    & Aronson, 1998)
    </i></p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="types of problems.png" alt="types of problems">
    </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> cost limitations, and on the <i>complexity </i> of the problem. A problem can be
    considered to be complex when:
    </p>
<ol type="a"> 
    <li> the number of variables and/or objectives increases (these are the
        <i>multidimensional problems with multiple objectives);</i>
        </li>
    <li> when the occurrence of the values of the variables and/or objectives is
        subject to <i> risks or uncertainty; </i> and</li>
    <li> when the values of the variable and objective are defined in an <i>imprecise
        or ambiguous way (they are fuzzy).</i>
        </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Figure 8.1. Classification of decision-making problems (adapted from
    Choo,1998; Kickert, 1978)</i></p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="classification of decision making problems.png" alt="classification of decision making problems">
    </div>  

<p style="text-align: justify;"> It is also possible to classify decision-making problems according to their
    <i>degree of uncertainty</i> (from absolute certainly to total lack of knowledge of
    the problem) and the level of <i>conflict of objectives</i> (involving complex,
    nonstructured and ambiguous problems) as shown in Figure 8.1.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> According to this classification we may have four basic models of decision
        problems:<i>rational model, descriptive model, political model, and ambiguous model.</i> Examples of these models are presented in this chapter. Detailed
        analysis and discussion of each type of model will be given in the next chapters.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Example 8.1. Selecting a real estate</i></p>
<div class="container">
    <img src="selecting a real estate.png" alt="selecting a real estate">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> There is no well-defined border between the models. Many problems have
    characteristics of more than one model.
    </p>
<h2> The Rational Model</h2>
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> This type of model, based on the principle of bounded rationality, defines
    structured decision making in situations with various possible decision alternatives. The alternatives are expressed through quantitative or qualitative variables, mathematical formulas, or transactional processes that do not involve the
    occurrence of uncertainty or risk. Often they are simplified representations of
    real problems and provide us with the first trial of the decision-making process
    (see Example 8.1).
    </p>
<h2>The Descriptive Model </h2>
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In this type of model, a decision is made according to a descriptive process
    similar to the procedure adopted in practice. The decision making process is
    aided by having the person or organization assign values to risk and uncertainty
    in an attempt to minimize the effect of uncertainty in the choice of alternatives.
    The resulting decision depends on the administrative behavior or structure
    adopted by the organization.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Example 8.2. Decision under risk</i></p>
<div class="container">
    <img src="decision under risk.png" alt="Decision under risk">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Example 8.3. Decision on a strategy for developing a project with multiple
    objectives and distinct scenarios</i></p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="decision on a strategy.png" alt="Decision on a strategy">
    </div>

<h2> The Political Model</h2>
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In this case, while the decision can be based on a rational model or a descriptive
    model, the increase in size and complexity of the problem does not allow an
    individual or small group of persons to choose the best alternative, since it could
    depend on a more extended analysis of the problem or, on negotiation or
    consensus among the parties involved (Example 8.3).</p>
<h2> Ambiguous Model</h2>
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Depending on the nature of the problem and type of persons involved, problems
    whose description is difficult or incomplete can occur. The problem may be
    described in an insufficient or imprecise way. On the other hand, the problem
    can be well formulated, but the decision making process can be difficult or
    fuzzy. As a result, decisions alternatives may be “ambiguous”, as frequently
    happens with qualitative judgment or judgments involving the merits of people
    or organizations.
    </p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Example: Selection of Used Cars </h1>
<div style="width: 1135px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The evaluation of used car usually involves a number of subjective criteria such
    as status of interior and exterior aspects of the car other than price, mileage, and
    year of fabrication. Each used car available in the inventory of a used car dealer,
    receives a preference or utility value (graded from 0 to 1) for each item to be
    evaluated. The dealer keeps the computerized record of evaluation of the items,
    and a number of photos of the car showing its actual status is available. Thus
    a client can examine any car available for sale even those stored in different
    shops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In the example presented by Terano et al. (1984), the selection of a car is made
    using three criteria defined by Shafer (1978):</p>
<li> <i>additive evaluation (Eadd)</i> corresponding to the arithmetic mean of the
    utility values,</li>
<li> <i>substitutive evaluation</i> using the Belief function or Lower Expected
    Value (Elower) of fuzzy theory, and</li>
<li> <i>complementary evaluation</i> based on the <i>Plausibility function</i> or
    Upper Expected Value (E
    upper
    ) of fuzzy theory.</li>
<p style="text-align: justify;" > Substitutive evaluation indicates the lower limit for the existence of negative
    values of an evaluated car, and complementary evaluation indicates the upper
    limit for the existence of positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following five criteria, placed in ascending order of importance, can be
    fixed (by the dealer):
     </p>

     <div class="container">
        <img src="formula.png" alt="formula">
    </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> According to this order of importance, criterion “s5 = price” is the most
    important criterion, while “s1 = year of fabrication” is the less important
    criterion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify ;"> A list of subjective preferences or weights for each criterion, indicated by m(si)
    or mi, defined by a certain client is:
    </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Table 8.1. Utility values for six used cars (adapted from Terano et al.,
    1984)
    </i></p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="utility values.png" alt="utility values">
    </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Table 8.2. Results of evaluation of six cars according to three expected
    values (adapted from Terano et al., 1984)
    </i></p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="result of evaluation.png" alt="result of evaluation">
    </div>
    <br> 
    <div class="container">
        <img src="formula 1.png" alt="formula 1">
    </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In this case, we can see that there is strong preference for the criterion “mileage”
    followed by “price” and “exterior aspects.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> As we can see, there is a difference between the “importance” and “preference”
    of a criterion. Criterion s5 is the “most important,” while the criterion s4 is the
    “most preferred” by the client. Mathematical reasons (Shafer, 1978) for this
    difference will be presented in Chapter X.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The utility values u (rl, sj), for each used car rl, l = 1, 2, ..., 6 and each criterion
    sj, j = 1,2,...,5 , are shown in Table 8.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> We can note that, with the exception of car number X768, every car presents
    at least one positive aspect (i.e., preference value is equal to or greater than
    0.7), showing that we have not the occurrence of dominance factor to eliminate
    some of these cars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The values of the three expected values (Elower, Eadd and E
    upperr
    ) and the
    respective ranking number for each car are listed in Table 8.2. Details for the
    calculation of these results will be shown in Chapter X.</p>
